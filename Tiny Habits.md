## Q1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

## Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
B=MAP helps create habits by making them easier to do. It stands for Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. The key is to start small (low Motivation) and make it super easy (high Ability). Pair the new habit with something you already do (Prompt) to remember and build routines.

## Q3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
