# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
- Examining someone from head to toe or gazing in a manner that induces discomfort.
- Inquiring intrusively about someone's sexual experiences or inclinations.
- Invading personal space by standing excessively close, making physical contact, or obstructing passage.
- Dispatching unwelcome sexually explicit communications via email, text, or social media.
- Engaging in any manner of improper physical contact, such as touching, groping, embracing, or kissing.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
- I will firmly convey to the individual engaging in harassment that their conduct is unwelcome and needs to cease.
- I will confide in a trusted individual about the incident, whether it's a friend, family member, or colleague.
- Documenting the occurrence, I will record pertinent details like dates, times, and specific actions or statements.
- I will report the harassment to the appropriate entity within my workplace, whether it's my employer, a supervisor, the HR department, or a designated harassment officer.
- I will contemplate seeking guidance from a lawyer specializing in employment law to gain clarity on my rights and potential legal recourse.
