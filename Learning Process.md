## Q2 In this video, What is Most intresting idea.
For me the best idea is the concept of focus and diffuse mode in our brain, so basically when we are focused on a problem and get stuck we just need to take a step back and go in a diffuse mode because in diffuse mode our brain can learn new things better as we are not just focused on one thing.

## Q3 What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
The Active mode of thinking involves focused, concentrated effort on a specific task or concept, often leading to deep understanding and retention of information. Diffused mode of thinking, on the other hand, occurs when the mind is in a relaxed, wandering state, allowing for connections between ideas and creative problem-solving.

## Q4 Steps to take when approaching a new topic.
- Deconstruct the skill 
- Learn enough to self-correct 
- Remove practice barriers
- Practice at least 20 hours

## Q5 What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- To learn the concepts in depth and do practical application.
- To implement the idea of focus and diffuse method.
- Also to explain to someone what I have learned.
